      <h3 id="blog1">Hidden Talent NO.1</h3>
      <p>I know how to play badminton. I've always enjoyed the sport since I was a child, and I used to 
          play it every week when I was in middle school. I haven't played it for a while now, so I'm quite rusty. 
          But badminton is still my favorite sport regardless.

      <p>I've never had a nose bleed.</p>
